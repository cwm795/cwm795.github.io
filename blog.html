        This is the first week we met our instructor, Joe. I had already been well aquainted with him but this was the first time the class got to meet him. We have begun to talk about javascript 101 and just the basics of JS.

    <h3>December</h3>
    <section>
        In December we've learned a lot of things. We had a project where we had to translate 4 different languages, my group chose German, French, Japaneese, and Spanish. We had another project where groups had to make a little "chat room". It was our first project with JSON. The point of a JSON file was to mimic what data from a database will look like. We were certainly happy that the project ended right before Christmas.

        We learned a lot in December. It's very easy to get lost in all the things we are learning at the pace that we're learning it. It's always good to look back at how far you've come since you've started.

<h3>Week of Jan 2nd</h3>
<section>
    We are back! As much as I would love another week, I still wanted to get back. Cabing Fever was definitely sinking in.
    We spent part of the first day reviewing stuff but for the most part of the week, we learned about JQuery. JQuery allows you to do the same stuff in vanilla JS, but with less keystrokes. Definitely a cool tool to have.

<h3>Week of Jan 8th</h3>
<section>
This week was intro to Firebase, whuch is a database that allows us to remotely store data. After learning about it, the class was immediately split into groups and started the "Themepark" project. I say "the class" because Joe wanted to pull me out and let me work on exercises. This was a good time to do it because I've done this project before so I'm not missing out. Class on Friday was cancelled due to winter weather.

<h3>Week of Jan 15th</h3>
<section>
   We came to school on that Monday and groups worked their project and I worked on my exercises. Tuesday and Wednesday we were closed due to winter weather. We started late on Thursday and talked about Firebase user auth. Friday started group projects called "Movie History" which focused on user authentication and using an API.

<h3>Week of Jan 22nd</h3>
<section>
    Monday we began building the project. I personally ran into issues with CORS errors with firebase but I eventually fixed that. Near the end, we were told to stop with our project and pick up where a different group left off so we can see what it's like to be told to change projects. It was frustrating especially because the project we picked up was behind from where our original project left off.
