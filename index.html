                <section>
                    I graduated Highschool in 2014 with desire to do something with technology. In February of 2016, I decided to teach myself to build a desktop computer. After finally saving up,
                    buying all the parts, and watching a few tutorials, I finished my first computer. Since then, my interest in building software has grown to the point that I want to do it as a career.
